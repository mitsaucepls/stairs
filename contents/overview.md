# Phillips official thought support about my topics

## Topics
Software Engineer / DevOps Engineer

### Onboarding
Familiarization and getting to know new systems. Accompanied by independent work.

- Backend, Frontend, Database connection (Spring, Angular and Postgres).
- CI/CD workflow (mostly gitlab pipelines).
- Monitoring Applications (prometheus combined with kibana and for logging elasticsearch).
- Routing and network background of our microservices (kubernetes and api gateway and i guess rhsso).

### Dependency Analysis
First WAB with python

- Learning new programming language (python).
- Working in a team with git.
- evaluating possibilities to achieve a solution.

### Pipeline refactoring && System Team
Manifest Pipeline refactoring (which got rejected.. but it was a nice experience non the less).

- Refactoring the structure of a legacy pipeline configuration and making it follow newer dogmatics.
- getting to know the already present configuration of the system team and developing a favor for it.
  - getting rejected of the system team on my attempt to apply for a position.
    - getting into the linux rabbit hole and changed for ever.
      - I love vim btw. Try it! Find Jesus! Get kids!

### Comparison of SpringWeb and SpringWebFlux
Second WAB going deep into the Spring Framework and Java.

- Hardcore researching about this framework.
- Comparing 2 example services and finding out a major bug inside the telekom libraries.
- Fixing the Bug on my machine but unfortunately never in general.
- Setting up load tests.

### Renovate Integration
Participation in the integration of new tools and features, e.g. Renovate.

- working together with senior devs and evaluating Renovate's capabilities.
- helping out Michael Krill on structuring and onboarding renovate.

### Monitoring of non functional requirements DevOps Maturity
Random project for Thea to evaluate the DevOps maturity levels and more via the atlassian gard telekom wiki and a python script.

- Started as a script and ended as a microservice, which got never deployed unfortunately. BUT IT WOULD HAVE WORKED!
- Further understanding of data structures and the importance of monitoring.

### Monitoring of non functional requirements LeanIX
Adding features to the LeanIX project. And with it making a side hustle into a component to rely on for informations.
But for real now doing the evaluation of the used security scanner of a microservice.

- Writing the first go project for crawling the gitlab api for security scanner jobs.
- Developing the logic of fetching the used security scanner jobs.
- Testing code for real the first time. I know crazy.
- All of this got the base of 2 or 3 more features of the leanix connector.

### PostgreSQL with JSONB
Exploring new techniques of combining databases with web frameworks.

- More communication with Phillip about WAB things.
- Deeper understanding of sql databases, especially postgresql.
- Knowing that someone wants this information.
- Presenting that information.

### PIP && other Events like Barcamp and We Are Developers
Getting to know the gigabit infrastructure and networking with various people.

- Visualize being part of something bigger.
- Networking attempts.
- Personal growth.
- Real fun with 'coworkers' or rather friends.

### WASMCloud and Kubernetes WITH RUST
experiencing a new way of thinking when doing applications.

- Under time pressure and too much other projects. Learning a whole new way of programming, making stuff and getting things done.
- Tinkering on a really undermatured framework of things basically a proof of concept without a real documentation.
- Setting up a kubernetes cluster from scratch with something other than containerized applications in it.
